# Project_Bl7ckLight_v2.0
This is my second project on Unity, where I realize Player Movement, Raycast system and etc. 
Project_Bl7ckLight_v2.0 it is an early demo version of the project, in which I implemented player control, shooting and made some objects on the map scripted. SOME OBJECTS OR CODE WERE NOT MADE FROM SCRATCH AND TAKEN FROM VARIOUS INTERNET SOURCES. THIS PROJECT IS A DEMO VERSION. If you want to get acquainted with the project in more detail, then I have attached a link in one of the files.
